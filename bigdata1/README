NOTE:

As the instruction permits in-memory storage thus applied Sqlite3 memory feature wich is more efficient error prone.
By using sqllite3 Library it will provide better indexing and serach capability plus a better memory management.
Plus Sqlite3 also handles multithreading but to be more carefull I still go with Lock on writing into memory
